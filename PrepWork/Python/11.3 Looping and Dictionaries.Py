If you use a dictionary in a for statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. For exam-
ple, print_hist prints each key and the corresponding value:
def print_hist(h):
for c in h:
print(c, h[c])
Hereâ€™s what the output looks like:
>>> h = histogram('parrot')
>>> print_hist(h)
a 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
o 1
Again, the keys are in no particular order. To traverse the keys in sorted order, you can use
the built-in function sorted:
>>> for key in sorted(h):
... print(key, h[key])
a 1
o 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
