Exercise 1
"""

# 42 = n
# SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

# How about x = y = 1?
# Legal

# In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
# Legal. Can use multiple statements in one line.

# What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
# Creates a tuple.

# In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y. What happens if you try that in Python?
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
