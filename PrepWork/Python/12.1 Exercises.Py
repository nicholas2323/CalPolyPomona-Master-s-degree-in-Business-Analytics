# Many of the built-in functions use variable-length argument tuples. For
# example, max and min can take any number of arguments:
# >>> max(1,2,3)
# 3
# But sum does not.
# >>> sum(1,2,3)
# TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3
# Write a function called sumall that takes any number of arguments and
# their sum.

# Current Status: Complete
