>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> greeting[0] = 'J'
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

The reason for the error is that strings are immutable, which means you canâ€™t change an
existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
>>> new_greeting
'Jello, world!'
