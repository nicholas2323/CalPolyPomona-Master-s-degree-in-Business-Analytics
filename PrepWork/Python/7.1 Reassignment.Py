A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop
referring to the old value).
>>> x = 5
>>> x
5
>>> x = 7
>>> x
7

In Python, an assignment statement can make two
variables equal, but they donâ€™t have to stay that way:
>>> a = 5
>>> b = a # a and b are now equal
>>> a = 3 # a and b are no longer equal
>>> b
5
